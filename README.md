# learning-JS
A small repository to track my process of learning JavaScript. 

**Functions** folder contains files with small tests of different functions. 

**Small Projects** folder contains files with small projects of mine which were made when I was suddenly struck with ideas for them. 

All these files are the result of me learning JavaScript, and were made at different times and stages of development, and as such some of them may heavily lack in quality.

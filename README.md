# learning-code
A small repository to track my process of learning code.

**Functions** folder contains files with small tests of different functions. 

**Small Projects** folder contains files with small projects of mine which were made when I was suddenly struck with ideas for them. 

Initially this repository was made as _learning-JS_, which meant it only included projects from my process of learning JavaScript. But as I started learning other languages, I decided to just keep adding to the same repository, so now it is _learning-code_. All these files are the result of me learning different programming languages, and were made at different times and stages of development, and as such some of them may heavily lack in quality.

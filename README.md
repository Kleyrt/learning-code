# learning-code
A small repository to track my process of learning code.

The names of the folders are pretty self-explanatory, but: 

  In JS folder:
    **Functions** folder contains files with small tests of different functions. 
    **Small Projects** folder contains files with small projects of mine which were made when I was suddenly struck with ideas for them. 

Initially this repository was made as _learning-JS_, which meant it only included projects from my process of learning JavaScript. But as I started learning other languages, I decided to just keep adding to the same repository by simply creating more folders, so now it is _learning-code_.
All these files are the result of me learning different programming languages, and were made at different times and stages of development/learning, thus some of them may heavily lack in quality. But, since the files were created for the purpose of revising some material in a categorised and short fashion, it still works.

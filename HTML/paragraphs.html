    And this text has pre-generated formatting. Here's some lyrics to prove it:

      [Verse 1]
      We're no strangers to love
      You know the rules and so do I
      A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
      You wouldn't get this from any other guy

      [Pre-Chorus]
      I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
      Gotta make you understand

      [Chorus]
      Never gonna give you up
      Never gonna let you down
      Never gonna run around and desert you
      Never gonna make you cry
      Never gonna say goodbye
      Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
    </pre>
